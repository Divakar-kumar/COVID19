Describes the major symptoms of COVID-19.

The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. They are usually mild and begin gradually. They appear around [2 - 14 days](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/symptoms.html) with average symptoms showing up after 5 days of being infected.

Some symptoms appear less common than others. The major symptoms of COVID-19 based on how [common](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus#the-symptoms-of-covid-19) it appears in the reported cases are

*   Fever
    
*   Dry Cough
    
*   Fatigue
    
*   Sputum Production
    
*   Shortness of Breath
    
*   Muscle Pain or Joint Pain
    
*   Sore Throat
    

Most of the symptoms overlap with those of flu and common cold. COVID-19 [rarely produces a runny nose.](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus#the-symptoms-of-covid-19)​"""},{"image":"precautions.png","color": AppColors.red,"data":"""Precautions and Preventive Measures
===================================


Describes the necessary preventive measures to the spread of COVID-19

Even though COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease, taking adequate precautions can help prevent you from being infected.

The virus spread through small droplets from the nose or mouth of the affected person, when the person sneezes or coughs. These droplets can travel more than 1 meter from the source and might land on objects and surfaces. Other people can catch the virus by touching the surface and then touching their eyes, mouth or nose. The virus can also be caught by inhaling these droplets if the distance between the affected person is less than one meter.



Preventive Measures
===============================================

There is no data showing that the virus can be transmitted through air. Hence, follow these steps to protect yourselves and the ones around you.

If you are above 60+ years of age or have any existing or past medical condition such as Heart diseases, Diabetes, Respiratory Diseases, Hypertension or any serious illness, you will have to take special precautions here.



Washing your hands frequently
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Since transmission mainly occurs through your hands, you should wash them frequently and thoroughly. It is recommended to use soap and water when available, else **use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol and rub until it dries.**

> **Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for atleast 20 seconds or an alcohol based hand sanitizer.**

Avoid Touching Your Eyes, Nose and Mouth
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The virus can come in contact with your skin at any time, particularly your hands. If the contaminated skin touched your eyes, nose or mouth the virus can be transferred into your body thereby infecting you.

> **Don't touch your face without washing your hands first.**

**Maintain Distance**
-----------------------------------------------

Depending on the level of outbreak in your local community it is [advised](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public) to keep a safe distance of at-least 1 meter (> 3 feet) from anyone who is coughing or sneezing. If you are in the vicinity when the person sneezes or coughs they can produce small droplets which you can inhale and become infected if the person is infected.

Cover Your Mouth and Nose while Sneezing or Coughing
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are coughing or sneezing do so while covering your face with a bent elbow or a hand kerchief. This would help prevent the spread viruses such as Flu, Cold or COVID-19.

If you think you have been infected, follow these specialized instructions for your safety and others.
"""},{"image":"how.png","color":AppColors.blue,"data":"""Guidelines for Home Quarantine
==============================

Home Quarantine Guidelines of COVID-19 are given below.

Introduction
=================================

*   Persons and household members should be educated about personal hygiene, basic IPC measures and how to care for the member of the family suspected of having COVID-19 disease as safely as possible to prevent the infection from spreading to household contacts.
    
*   The persons and the family should be provided with ongoing support and education, and monitoring should continue for the duration of home care.
    

Recommendations
=======================================

*   Persons and families should adhere to the following recommendations:-
    
    *   Place the person in a well-ventilated single room (i.e . with open windows and an open door)
        
    *   Limit the movement of the person in the house and minimize shared space. Ensure that shared spaces (e.g., kitchen, bathroom) are well ventilated (e.g., keep windows open).
        
    *   Household members should stay in a different room or, if that is not possible. maintain a distance of at least 1 mt from the ill person.
        
    *   Limit the number of caregivers, ideally, assign one person who is in a good health and has no underlying chronic or immuno compromised conditions. Visitors should not be allowed until the person has completely recovered and has no signs and symptoms.
        
    *   Perform hand hygiene after any type of contact with person or their immediate environment. Hand hygiene should also be performed before and after preparing food, before eating, after using the toilets and whenever hands look dirty. If hands are not visibly dirty. an alcohol-based hand rub can be used For visibly dirty hands, use soap and water.
        
    *   When washing hands with soap and water, it is preferable to use
        
        disposable paper towels to dry hands. If these are not available. use clean cloth rowels and replace them when they become wet. Disposable paper towels should be disposed off in closed bins only.
        
    *   To contain respiratory secretions, a medical mask should be provided to the person and worn as much as possible. Materials used to cover the mouth and nose should be discarded or cleaned appropriately after use (e.g., wash handkerchiefs using regular soap or detergent and water).
        
    *   Caregivers should wear a tightly fitted medical mask that covers their mouth and nose when in the same room as the person. Masks should not be touched or handled during use If the mask gets wet or dirty from secretions, it must be replaced immediately with a new clean, dry mask. Remove the mask using the appropriate technique — that is, do not touch the front, but instead untie it Discard the mask immediately after use and perform hand hygiene.
        
    *   Avoid direct contact with body fluids, particularly oral or respiratory
        
        secretions, and stool. Use disposal gloves and a mask when providing oral or respiratory care and when handling stool, urine. and other waste. Perform hand hygiene before and after removing gloves and mask.
        
    *   Do not reuse masks or gloves
        
    *   Use dedicated linen and eating utensils for the person; these items should
        
        be cleaned with soap and water after use and may be re-used instead of being discarded. They should be washed at 60-90 oC with common household detergent, and dry thoroughly. Place contaminated linen into a laundry bag.
        
    *   Clean and disinfect daily surfaces that are frequently touched in the room where the person is being cared for, such as bedside tables. bed frames and other bedroom furniture. Regular household soap or detergent should be used first for cleaning, and then, after rinsing, regular household disinfectant containing 0.5% sodium hypochlorite ( i.e., equivalent to 5000 pm or 1 part bleach 5 to 9 parts water) should be applied.
        
    *   Clean and disinfect bathroom and toilet surfaces at least once daily. Regular household soap or detergent should be used first for cleaning. and then, after rinsing, regular household disinfectant containing 0.5% to 1% sodium hypochlorite should be applied.
        
    *   Avoid other types of exposure to contaminated items from the person's immediate environment (e.g.. do not share toothbrushes, cigarettes. eating utensils, dishes, drinks, towels, washcloths or bed linen)."""},{"image":"faq.png","color":AppColors.yellow,"data":"""FAQ

Frequently Asked Questions about COVID-19

What is a Corona Virus?
------------------------------------------------------

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.

What is COVID-19?
------------------------------------------

COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.

What are the symptoms of COVID-19 ?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.

How does COVID-19 spread ?
-----------------------------------------------------------

People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.

> WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings.

What can i do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease ?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:

*   Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.
    
*   Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
    
*   Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.
    
*   Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.
    
*   Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.
    
*   Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places – especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease.
    

How likely am I to catch COVID-19 ?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The risk depends on where you are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there.

For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places around the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to comply with any local restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading COVID-19.

COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in China and some other countries. Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It’s important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go. WHO publishes daily updates on the COVID-19 situation worldwide.

Who is at risk of developing severe illness ?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

While we are still learning about how COVID-2019 affects people, older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes) appear to develop serious illness more often than others.

Are there any medicines or therapies that can prevent or cure COVID-19 ?[](#are-there-any-medicines-or-therapies-that-can-prevent-or-cure-covid-19)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, there is no evidence that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease. WHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19. However, there are several ongoing clinical trials that include both western and traditional medicines. WHO will continue to provide updated information as soon as clinical findings are available.

Should I wear a mask to protect myself ?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19. Disposable face mask can only be used once. If you are not ill or looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is a world-wide shortage of masks, so WHO urges people to use masks wisely.

WHO advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary wastage of precious resources and mis-use of masks (see Advice on the use of masks).

The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing. See basic protective measures against the new coronavirus for more information.

Is there anything I should not do ?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following measures **ARE NOT effective** against COVID-19 and can be harmful:

*   Smoking
*   Wearing multiple masks
*   Taking antibiotics
    

In any case, if you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early to reduce the risk of developing a more severe infection and be sure to share your recent travel history with your health care provider.
